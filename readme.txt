Liteweight sitemap generator for Google News that is actually working and easier to use than any of the existing plugins. 

== Description == 

I looked for a plugin the other day to generate a proper Google News sitemap. Unfortunately, most of them were either not working, premium plugins or too bloated. 
After looking for a good while and testing a handful of plugins, I set out to make a plugin that is compatible with recent Google News additions, including the possibility to specify many parameters manually.  
 
I hope to maintain this plugin throughout 2014 and 2015 and add a few more features. If there are any bugs please report them so they can be fixed with the next release.  

= Some of the new features =

* Provide publication name manually - if you don't want it to be your Homepage name
* Provide site language using Google's language codes
* Provide related stock tickers manually
* Rather than excluding categories, this plugin allows you to include categories only


= Why You Should Include Only A Few Categories =

Google is very picky about what sites they include. If you create a sitemap that is fetching content from your entire site, you won't get accepted. 

It is a far better idea to create a "News" and "Opinion Piece" category


= What features will you add in the next version =

Next on the list are additional genres: Opinion Piece, Op/Ed and other genres accepted by Google.

  
= How do I avoid my blog from dropping out of Google News =
